# How Trade Policy COP Works

## What a user provides
- Export country
- Import country
- Product details
- Value and quantity

## What the system does
1. Identifies applicable trade framework
2. Applies domain-specific logic (MFA / FTA)
3. Runs revenue integrity checks
4. Flags risks or required actions

## What the user gets
- Applicable policy
- Required compliance steps
- Risk indicators
- Clear next actions

## Why it is reliable
- Based on official trade data sources
- No invented rules or assumptions
- Clear separation of logic and data

## Safeguards & Overlays
The system flags additional trade measures (e.g., U.S. Section 232, AD/CVD)
that apply on top of MFN or FTA treatment. These are not preferential regimes
but mandatory compliance overlays.
