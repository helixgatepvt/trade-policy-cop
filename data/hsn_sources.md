# HSN — Source of Truth

## Primary Authority
- World Customs Organization (WCO) — Harmonized System

## National Implementations
- India: Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT)
- European Union: TARIC (EU Integrated Tariff)

## Usage Rule
- Classification follows WCO HS structure
- Country-specific extensions are applied only after base HS is identified

## Assumptions
- System does not invent HSN codes
- If classification is ambiguous, user clarification is required
